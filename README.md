# AidLearning-FrameWork
 **AidLearning** is a Linux system running on the Android with GUI, Deep-Learning and  Python Visual Programming support . The [AidLearning](http://www.aidlearning.net) framework which have the <b>Linux+Anroid+AI+Python 4in1</b> environments Developed and Maintained by several students from [Cas University](http://english.cas.cn) and [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu).

AidLearning App builds a ***graphical interface Linux*** system (without need root) **on Android phones** and coexists with your Android system.  The App has a built-in system of leading deep learning frameworks, including ***Caffe, Tensorflow, Mxnet, pytorch, keras, ncnn and opencv***. You no longer need complex configuration, wall-turning downloads and Install dependency packages.



AidLearning is also a ***pocket AI programming tool***. The built-in AICode visual IDE allows you to easily program on your mobile phone with Python (supporting Python 2 and Python 3), support ***touch-and-drag*** interface design, support real-time debugging and graphical running of codes. AidLearning has a large number of AI source code examples, which include face recognition, pose recognition and classification. You can develop the AI App on mobile phones on a ***zero-based*** basis.

In addition, AidLearning provides wifi-based mapping projection technology, which can project mobile phone code to PC for Web interactive programming and ***SSH*** remote command interaction.  Easy viewing on televisions and the ability to projector for large screen display, ensures the ability to present in group settings.



In short, AidLearning has created a touch-and-drag programming platform for rapid development and learning that combines ***Android + Linux + AI  3IN1 environments***. It utilizes mobile phones for fragmented programming and fully optimizes use of the development advantages of the two major operating systems (Android + Linux) and the perfect terminal advantages of mobile phones. AidLearning  offers a distinct advantage to its users through an effective new platform for programming learning and development.

**AidLearning App在Android手机上构建了一个带图形界面的Linux系统(不需要root)，和你的Android系统共生共存，并内置了目前排名top7的深度学习框架包括Caffe、Tensorflow、Mxnet、pytorch、keras、ncnn、opencv，你不再需要复杂的配置和翻墙安装依赖包。**

**AidLearning同时是一款口袋AI编程工具，内置的AiCode可视化编程器，可以让你在手机上用python（同时支持Python2和Python3）轻松零基础编程，支持触摸拖拽式界面设计 ，支持代码实时调试和图形化运行。Aid Learning内置大量人脸识别、行为识别、分类等AI源码例子程序，你可以零基础在手机上开发AI App。**

**此外，Aid Learning提供了基于wifi的映射投屏技术，可以把手机的代码投屏到电脑pc进行web互动编程和SSH远程命令交互，同时也可投影到电视机、投影仪进行大屏显示。**

**总之，Aid Learning打造了一个Android+Linux+AI 三合一的触摸拖拽式的快速开发和学习平台，不仅可利用手机进行碎片式编程，同时可充分利用两大主流操作系统（Android+Linux）的开发优势和手机的完美终端优势，利用这种优势，Aid Learning打造了一个完美的编程学习和开发的新平台。**

# Powerful
Caffe, Tensorflow, Mxnet, ncnn, Keras...Almost include all the AI framework , you don't need to config the AI framework complexly. All build in one !

# Graphical User Interface
We fixed Graphical User Interface for the Linux on Andorid(It has been pruned by andorid!), so you can use the GUI just like on the pc. For instance, You can use opencv to open and view camera!

# Real-Time
Real linux running on the busybox and not virtul environment like VirtulBox. So it is faster and almost real-time

# Easy to use
We provide a plenty of examples and by using our framework, you can run it with a tap, and then get a visual log to show the informations or errors.

# Coding anywhere
You can coding on your phone anywhere, anytime. Every inch of fragmentation have been fully utilized. Your creativity can be instantly realized with a flash of inspiration.

# Energy Star

According to the test on the mainstream smartphone like Samsung, Aid Learning Framework only use 1% power consumption in a whole day (Standby)
